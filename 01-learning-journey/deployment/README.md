# Deployment Learning Journey

This folder documents the evolution of BLKOUT platform deployment strategies.

## Timeline

1. **v1-initial-netlify-supabase.md** - Started with Netlify + Supabase
2. **v2-vercel-migration.md** - Moved to Vercel for better performance
3. **v3-coolify-self-hosted.md** - Self-hosted for cost control
4. **v4-production-config.md** - Current production setup

## Key Decisions

- Chose self-hosting for cooperative ownership alignment
- Standardised on Docker multi-stage builds
- Consolidated to single VPS with Coolify management

## Lessons Learned

1. Start simple, scale when needed
2. Document everything for future maintainers
3. Cost control matters for community organisations
4. Self-hosting requires more knowledge but offers more control
