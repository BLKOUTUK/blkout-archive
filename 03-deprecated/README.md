# Deprecated Code & Configs

Code and configurations no longer in active use.

## Structure

- `old-configs/` - Deprecated configuration files
- `unused-features/` - Features that were built but not taken forward

## Why Keep These?

- Reference for similar future implementations
- Understanding past architectural decisions
- Potential revival of features
